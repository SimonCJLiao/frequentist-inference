# regression project
Here is one .RMD file, the part3.R script, two images, and one data.RData file. The reason of using an R script for part 3 is that it takes too long to run the code when I try to produce the pdf file.
.RMD file: Text and code of the regression project
R script part3.R : do iteration in part 3 and save the data in a .RData file
Two images: one is the lm output that we try to reproduce in part2 (b), the other is the plot we try to reproduce in part 3
data.RData: produced by the R script, include the `data` object with 3 columns and 1000 rows, which is the result of 1000 iteration for n = 100, 500, 1000
